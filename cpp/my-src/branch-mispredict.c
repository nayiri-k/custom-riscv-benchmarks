#define ARRAY_SIZE 10000

// In this program, we create an array of integers and iterate through it. The branch misprediction is caused by the conditional branch within the loop, which checks whether each element of the array is even or odd and then performs addition or subtraction accordingly. The unpredictability of the branch outcomes can lead to branch mispredictions and slower program execution.

int main() {
    int array[ARRAY_SIZE];
    int sum = 0;

    // Initialize the array with random values
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        array[i] = i;
    }

    // Access the array with a conditional branch
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        if (array[i] % 2 == 0) {
            sum += array[i];
        } else {
            sum -= array[i];
        }
    }

    // Print the result to prevent the compiler from optimizing the loop away
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
